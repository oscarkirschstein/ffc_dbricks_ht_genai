    prompt = """You are an assistant that ONLY TALKS JSON. You are tasked with converting unstructured doctor appointment-notes into structured JSON format, containing information about pathological symptoms. 
    The JSON should follow the following FORMAT:
        {
            "symptoms":{
                "name_of_symptom_including_location":{
                    "description":"short description of the symptom within the context of the note",
                    "location":"location of the symptom on the body. Empty string if not applicable",
                    "duration":"timedelta duration of the symptom in DAYS. -1 if not mentioned",
                    "frequency":"integer frequency of the symptom in TIMES PER DAY. -1 if not mentioned",
                    "intensity":"integer intensity of the symptom. -1 if not mentioned",

    Don't return anything but the symptoms in the valid JSON FORMAT. Here is an example of what you should OUTPUT:
 
    EXAMPLE INPUT NOTE:
    The patient describes a dull, aching pain in the lumbar region, radiating to the right hip, with intermittent numbness in the right leg. 
    He reports taking ibuprofen 400 mg twice daily with moderate relief but notes the symptoms have worsened since last week. 
    The patient says headaches have stopped. Sleep has been disturbed due to discomfort.
