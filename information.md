## 2. Objectives and Goals

**Problem Statement**:  
Medical notes are typically written in unstructured natural language, making it difficult to analyze trends, track symptoms, and process medical data at scale. This tool addresses the need for automated conversion of free-text medical notes into structured data.

**Objectives**:  
1. Convert unstructured doctor's notes into structured JSON format
2. Extract and categorize symptoms with detailed attributes
3. Identify primary pathologies from medical notes
4. Provide an easy-to-use interface for medical professionals

**Success Metrics**:  
- Accuracy of symptom extraction
- Accuracy of pathology identification
- User satisfaction with JSON output format
- Processing time per note

## 3. Scope and Exclusions

**In-Scope**:  
- Web-based interface for note input
- Symptom extraction and categorization
- Pathology identification
- JSON file generation and storage
- File preview functionality
- Multiple file management

**Out of Scope**:  
- Permanent database storage
- User authentication
- Medical diagnosis generation
- Treatment recommendations
- Integration with EMR systems
