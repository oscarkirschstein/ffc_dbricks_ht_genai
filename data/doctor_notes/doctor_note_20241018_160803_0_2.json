  "doctor_note": "The patient describes worsening symptoms, with sharp pain now radiating down to the calf and foot, with intermittent weakness in the right leg. Pain intensity has escalated to 8/10. Walking is significantly impaired, and the patient reports tripping on uneven surfaces due to leg weakness. Sleep is highly disturbed despite pain medications. Naproxen has provided minimal relief. Numbness in the right leg has become persistent. The patient denies bowel or bladder dysfunction but is visibly frustrated by the lack of improvement. Referred for a neurologist consultation and prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.",
